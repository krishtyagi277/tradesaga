This also provides a tremendous opportunity for our biggest asset, the team, to gain access to career growth within the well-established Acclime group.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Mr Crawford said the acquisition of The CFO Solution puts Acclime at the forefront of innovation in the corporate services sector.\u00a0Acclime\u2019s continued growth, both organically and through strategic acquisitions, is enabling the group to nurture and develop established local teams with the added expertise and support of a regional network.<\/p>\n<p>Acclime first entered the Australian corporate services sector in 2021 with the acquisition of CoSec Corporate Services, followed by the acquisition of Melbourne-based consultancy Mertons in 2022. The acquisition of The CFO Solution enables Acclime to support the complete spectrum of corporate clients, from start-ups, FDI entrants, pre-IPO corporates as well as to listed clients.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThese acquisitions not only expand Acclime\u2019s Australian footprint but they also serve a far broader purpose in enhancing our corporate governance services and technological capabilities across Asia,\u201d Mr Crawford said.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Acclime Australia has expanded its position in the corporate services sector with the strategic acquisition of leading Melbourne advisory firm, The CFO Solution.\u00a0 Established in Melbourne in 2000, The CFO Solution provides virtual CFO-level financial strategy and reporting advice, capital-raising assistance, company secretarial services, accounts payable, and consulting services.\u00a0The company has specialised in assisting clients [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":6620,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[97],"tags":[],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.acclime.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/6617"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.acclime.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.acclime.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.acclime.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/2"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.acclime.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=6617"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.acclime.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/6617\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.acclime.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/6620"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.acclime.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=6617"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.acclime.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=6617"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.acclime.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=6617"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
