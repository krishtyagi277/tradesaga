As a corporate services specialist positioned to assist with FDI in Asia, we bring you some of the Asia highlights from UNCTAD\u2019s\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/unctad.org\/system\/files\/official-document\/wir2021_en.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">World Investment Report 2021<\/a> which was published on June 21, 2021.<\/p>\n<p>Foreign direct investment (FDI) flows to developing countries in Asia increased by 4% to $535 billion in 2020, reflecting resilience amid global FDI contraction, according to the report.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cDespite the pandemic, FDI to and from the region remained resilient in 2020. Developing Asia is the only region recording FDI growth, accounting for more than half of global inward and outward FDI flows,\u201d said UNCTAD\u2019s director of investment and enterprise, James Zhan.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cFDI prospects in 2021 for Asia are more favourable than the global average, because of recovery in trade, manufacturing activities and a strong GDP growth forecast,\u201d he added.<\/p>\n<h2>More than half of global flows<\/h2>\n<p>The region, already the world\u2019s largest FDI recipient in 2019, received more than half of global FDI. Growth was driven by China, Hong Kong (China), India and the United Arab Emirates. Elsewhere in the region, FDI contracted. In economies where FDI is concentrated in tourism or manufacturing, contractions were particularly severe.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/unctadfig1-2.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.acclime.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/unctadfig1-2.jpg\" alt=\"UNCTAD Global FDI inflow 2020 graph\" width=\"1000\" height=\"669\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-3586\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.acclime.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/unctadfig1-2.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/www.acclime.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/unctadfig1-2-300x201.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.acclime.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/unctadfig1-2-768x514.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>East Asia<\/h3>\n<p>Flows to East Asia rose by 21% to $292 billion, inflated by the FDI recovery in Hong Kong (China), which surged by 62% (to $119 billion), after a sharp fall of FDI in 2019 and due to corporate reconfigurations by\u00a0multinational enterprises\u00a0(MNEs) headquartered in the economy.<\/p>\n<p>In China, FDI growth picked up pace in 2020 (growing by 6% to $149 billion), reflecting the country\u2019s success in containing the pandemic and its rapid GDP growth recovery.\u00a0The growth was driven by technology-related industries, e-commerce and research and development.<\/p>\n<p>In the Republic of Korea, FDI declined by 4% to $9 billion. Though the country was among the earliest to contain the COVID-19 outbreak and economic growth remained strong, a large drop in cross-border\u00a0mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;As) due to large divestments led to a decline in investment.<\/p>\n<h3>South-East Asia<\/h3>\n<p>South-East Asia, an engine of global FDI growth for the past decade, recorded a 25% FDI contraction to $136 billion.<\/p>\n<p>Singapore, Indonesia and Viet Nam, the region\u2019s largest FDI recipients in that order, all recorded FDI declines. FDI to Singapore fell by 21% to $91 billion, to Indonesia by 22% to $19 billion, and to Viet Nam by 2% to $16 billion.<\/p>\n<p>Lockdown measures, successive waves of COVID-19 infection, supply chain disruption, falling corporate earnings, economic uncertainties and delayed investment plans were key reasons for the contraction.<\/p>\n<p>In Thailand, FDI sank to -$6 billion, driven by the divestment of Tesco (United Kingdom) to a Thai investor group for $10 billion. In Malaysia, FDI fell by 55% to $3 billion. FDI in Cambodia was flat at $3.6 billion thanks to inflows in finance. In Myanmar, FDI dropped 34% to $1.8 billion.<\/p>\n<h3>South Asia<\/h3>\n<p>FDI in South Asia rose by 20% to $71 billion, driven mainly by a 27% rise in FDI in India to $64 billion.<\/p>\n<p>In India, robust investment in ICT and construction bolstered FDI inflows. Cross-border M&amp;As surged 83% to $27 billion, with major deals involving ICT, health, infrastructure and energy.<\/p>\n<p>FDI fell in other South Asian economies that rely on export-oriented garment manufacturing. Inflows in Bangladesh and Sri Lanka contracted by 11% and 43% respectively.\u00a0In Pakistan, FDI was down by 6% to $2.1 billion, cushioned by continued investments in power generation and telecommunication industries.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/unctadfig2-1.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.acclime.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/unctadfig2-1.jpg\" alt=\"UNCTAD FDI inflow graph 2020 Asia\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-3588\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.acclime.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/unctadfig2-1.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/www.acclime.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/unctadfig2-1-300x300.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.acclime.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/unctadfig2-1-150x150.jpg 150w, https:\/\/www.acclime.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/unctadfig2-1-768x768.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Outflows<\/h2>\n<p>Outward FDI (OFDI) from Asia increased by 7% to $389 billion \u2013 again, the only region recording expansion in outflows. This underscores the region\u2019s prominence as an important investor for the developing region.<\/p>\n<p>The growth was driven by strong investment from Hong Kong (China) and Thailand. China, the largest investor country in 2020, saw OFDI stabilizing at $133 billion. The country\u2019s tighter screening of OFDI, added to heightened scrutiny by the United States of investments originating from China, weighed on the country\u2019s OFDI since 2017.<\/p>\n<p>Continued expansion of Chinese MNEs and active M&amp;A purchases abroad underpinned the stabilization in 2020.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/unctadfig3-1.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/www.acclime.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/unctadfig3-1.jpg\" alt=\"UNCTAD FDI outflow graph 2020 Asia\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1116\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-3589\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.acclime.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/unctadfig3-1.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/www.acclime.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/unctadfig3-1-269x300.jpg 269w, https:\/\/www.acclime.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/unctadfig3-1-918x1024.jpg 918w, https:\/\/www.acclime.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/unctadfig3-1-768x857.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Prospects<\/h2>\n<p>FDI prospects for the region are more favourable than the global outlook, with a projected growth of 5% to 10%, thanks to resilient intraregional value chains and strong economic growth prospects.
