So how has the ease of doing business in Asia changed in 2023? Several countries have implemented or plan to enact significant reforms to enhance the ease of doing business, promote economic growth, and increase foreign investment.<\/p>\n<p>This article will highlight some of the most significant business reforms taking place across Asia in 2023.<\/p>\n<div class=\"uk-alert\" style=\"padding: 30px 40px;\">\n<h3 class=\"uk-margin-remove-top\">Contents<\/h3>\n<ul class=\"uk-list uk-list-collapse uk-nav-default\">\n<li><a href=\"#part1\" uk-scroll=\"offset:100\">China<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#part2\" uk-scroll=\"offset:100\">Hong Kong<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#part3\" uk-scroll=\"offset:100\">India<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#part4\" uk-scroll=\"offset:100\">Indonesia<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#part5\" uk-scroll=\"offset:100\">Malaysia<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#part6\" uk-scroll=\"offset:100\">Philippines<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#part7\" uk-scroll=\"offset:100\">Singapore<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#part8\" uk-scroll=\"offset:100\">Thailand<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#part9\" uk-scroll=\"offset:100\">Vietnam<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/div>\n<h2 id=\"part1\">China \ud83c\udde8\ud83c\uddf3<\/h2>\n<p class=\"uk-text-muted\">World Bank Ease of Doing Business in Asia ranking: 12th<br \/>\nGlobal ranking: 31st<\/p>\n<h3>E-invoicing in China<\/h3>\n<p>In December 2021, a pilot program for a fully digitalised VAT and proof-of-purchase form called <em>e-fapiao<\/em> was launched in select regions of China. The word <em>fapiao <\/em>is romanised from the ideogram \u53d1\u7968 and is the traditional Chinese legal proof of purchase for goods or services, i.e., a receipt. The pandemic lockdowns across China drove the need for a virtual, electronic version of the <em>fapiao<\/em>, hence the <em>e-fapiao<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>The initial trial included Shanghai, Guangdong and Inner Mongolia. The <em>e-fapiao<\/em> rollout will continue to expand in 2023 to cover more taxpayers. By 2025, <em>e-fapiao<\/em> is expected to be completely accessible all around the country.<\/p>\n<p>The fully digitalised <em>e-fapiao<\/em> has the same legal effect and usage as the traditional paper <em>fapiao<\/em>. In addition to the environmental and cost-saving benefits of going paperless, it will offer businesses several other advantages. These include better integration with other electronic systems for accounting and reporting.<\/p>\n<p>From 20 January 2023 to 30 March 2023, the pilot program of issuing fully digitalised <em>e-fapiao<\/em> expanded to cover taxpayers in Shanghai, Chongqing, Qingdao, Dalian, Tianjin, Shaanxi, Henan, Jilin, Shenzhen, Ningbo, Fujian, and Yunnan.<\/p>\n<h3>Expanding the \u201cencouraged industries\u201d catalogue to boost foreign investment<\/h3>\n<p>The National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) and the Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) introduced the Catalogue of Encouraged Industries for Foreign Investment (2022) on 1 January 2023. It replaces the 2020 version. The purpose of the document is to guide foreign investment and expertise into areas of the Chinese economy in need of development. Industries are placed into four categories of foreign investment: Encouraged, Permitted, Restricted and Prohibited.<\/p>\n<p>Encouraged industries are given favourable treatment, such as tax benefits, compared to those in the neural Permitted category. Foreign investment in Restricted industries is limited to minority shareholding in joint ventures, and it is completely forbidden in the Prohibited category.<\/p>\n<p>The updated catalogue includes additions and modifications that cover end product manufacturing, components and parts manufacturing, and raw materials manufacturing. In the services industry, foreign investment is encouraged in production-oriented services, such as R&amp;D and logistics. There are also regional catalogues to cater to the specific advantages of China\u2019s central, western, and northwestern regions.<\/p>\n<p>Foreign investment is encouraged in the following sectors:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Healthcare<\/strong> \u2013 developing drugs for rare diseases and special drugs for children; manufacturing dental implant systems; production, research and development of therapeutic medical and health textiles; hearing aid and cochlear implant manufacturing; rehabilitation for autistic children<\/li>\n<li><strong>Sports<\/strong> \u2013 construction, operation, and management of fitness facilities; research and development of snow and ice heavy equipment; intelligent sports products and services.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Elderly care<\/strong> \u2013 research and development of smart healthcare products and elderly care-related services<\/li>\n<li><strong>Rural revitalisation<\/strong> \u2013 water-saving irrigation, rural environmental remediation, smart agriculture, rural tourism<\/li>\n<li><strong>Vocational education<\/strong> \u2013 non-academic language and art training<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Foreign-invested enterprises (FIEs) doing business in Encouraged industries are entitled to benefits such as tariff exemptions on imported equipment, access to preferential land prices, and reduced corporate income tax in the western regions and Hainan.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"part2\">Hong Kong \ud83c\udded\ud83c\uddf0<\/h2>\n<p class=\"uk-text-muted\">World Bank Ease of Doing Business in Asia ranking: 2nd<br \/>\nGlobal ranking: 3rd<\/p>\n<h3>New foreign-sourced income regime<\/h3>\n<p>Hong Kong introduced a new foreign-sourced income regime on 1 January 2023.

The incentives include corporate tax exemptions, tax holidays, import tax exemptions, personal income tax exemptions for priority project investment, and the ability to hire foreign employees for up to 10 years.<\/p>\n<p>For domestic taxpayers who invest IDR 10 billion in the new capital city, the government will provide an exemption from corporate income tax of up to 100% for a period of between 10 and 30 years. The sectors of investment determine the period of the incentive.<\/p>\n<p>Businesses in the new capital city will be able to hire foreign employees for 10 years. The foreign employees can also obtain residency permits for 10 years, which can be extended depending on the employment contract terms. The employer is not required to pay into the Foreign Worker Compensation Fund, which normally requires a monthly payment of USD 100 to the Ministry of Manpower.<\/p>\n<p>The government is also providing investors with 95-year land use permits. These can be extended for another 95 years for a total of 190 years of land usage.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"part5\">Malaysia \ud83c\uddf2\ud83c\uddfe<\/h2>\n<p class=\"uk-text-muted\"><a href=\"https:\/\/archive.doingbusiness.org\/en\/rankings\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">World Bank Ease of Doing Business in Asia<\/a> ranking: 5th<br \/>\nGlobal ranking: 12th<\/p>\n<h3>Changes to corporate and individual taxes<\/h3>\n<p>The Malaysian government introduced changes to the corporate and individual tax regimes in the 2023 Budget, effective 1 January 2023.<\/p>\n<p>MSMEs (Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises) are subject to a corporate income tax rate of 15% for the first RM 150,000 of chargeable income.
