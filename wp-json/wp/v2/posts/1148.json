In a market characterised by increasing sophistication and complexity, Acclime\u2019s vision is to reinvent the corporate services sector with innovative solutions that are seamlessly delivered to the highest global standards. Two of the industry\u2019s most experienced executives, Martin Crawford and Debby Davidson, have joined forces to establish Acclime, backed by a consortium of investors.<\/p>\n<p>Through acquisitions and partnerships with well-established and highly respected firms, Acclime has already built a strong presence in four markets in the region since January 2019.  The company now has more than 150 employees serving the needs of both listed and privately-owned corporate clients.  In Hong Kong, Acclime acquired three businesses, namely BPO Global, Macaw Corporate Services and Edtoma Corporate Services. In Thailand, Acclime acquired Interactive Associates, while in Indonesia and Vietnam, Acclime acquired strategic interests in Magna Praxis and Domicile Corporate Services, respectively.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe see a clear opportunity to become the leader in the ever-evolving corporate governance regime in emerging Asia,\u201d Martin Crawford, co-founder and CEO of Acclime said. \u201cWith our in-country expertise and the use of leading technology applications, Acclime is well-positioned to be the one-stop service provider for those clients operating in and throughout the region who demand the highest international standards, even in the difficult to navigate emerging Asian markets.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Crawford noted that companies are facing increasing regulatory and disclosure obligations, requiring in-country expert support.  Moreover, through foreign direct investment and cross-border trade, Asia is increasing its connectivity both regionally and globally. This creates a need for higher and more consistent corporate governance standards.<\/p>\n<p>The management team of Acclime intends to build a substantial presence in each key Asian market.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe are actively seeking opportunities to expand our footprint in other emerging markets in the region.
