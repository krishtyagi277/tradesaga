The arrangement, which sees 18 of NVM\u2019s clients consensually move to Acclime Vietnam and NVM\u2019s Vietnam staff move into Acclime Vietnam\u2019s new Ho Chi Minh City offices, came into effect on June 1st.<\/p>\n<p>NVM Group specialised in HR services, payroll outsourcing and employee hosting (sometimes referred to as PEO (Principal Employment Organisation) or EOR (Employer of Record) services) in Vietnam, Cambodia and Myanmar. When faced with the need to transfer existing clients to a trusted firm, as well as find a new home and career path for its loyal staff, NVM\u2019s owner, Mr Quan Huynh, had only one corporate services provider in mind \u2013 Acclime. The entire transfer project was completed in only one month, ensuring a seamless transition for clients and their employees.<\/p>\n<p>PEO is a highly convenient way for a foreign-owned company to get started in a country before they have set up their own subsidiary or branch office and obtained the relevant permits, bank accounts, compliance staff and so on. Many clients find this arrangement so convenient, they never \u2018in-source\u2019 the employees, but continue to use the PEO provider after establishment.<\/p>\n<p>Acclime\u2019s footprint across Asia includes fully owned subsidiaries in Vietnam and Cambodia and a strong affiliate partner in Myanmar, meaning the geographical fit with NVM Group was good. In addition, Acclime, via the Asian subsidiaries that have joined the group, has been providing HR outsourcing, payroll and PEO services to clients for over 10 years. Acclime specialises in providing premier corporate services to foreign companies expanding to Asian markets through expertise in navigating the complexities of compliance regulations.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe are delighted to welcome and serve NVM Group\u2019s clients and their employees.\u201d Matthew Lourey, Managing Partner of Acclime Vietnam said \u201cIt is exciting to bring about a transaction like this, bringing into our Vietnam operations the NVM team and clients, especially as the professional and international nature of the staff and clients of NVM matches very well with the culture that we all live at Acclime.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhen NVM considered options for selling its Outsourced Employment Services business, we had no hesitation in choosing Acclime by reason of the trust they have built in the industry, and I believe that their service standards are second to none in Vietnam,\u201d Mr Quan Huynh, owner of NVM said. \u201cAfter nearly 18 years of operations, NVM Group is pleased to divest its businesses in Vietnam, Cambodia and Myanmar to Acclime &#8211; the fast growing corporate services company in Asia. Knowing that our clients and staff would be exceedingly well looked after by Acclime was a major factor in the decision.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Details of Acclime Vietnam\u2019s services and leadership team and can be found at <a href=\"https:\/\/vietnam.acclime.com\/news-insights\/quarterly-vietnam-hr-payroll-updates-april-2021\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">vietnam.acclime.com<\/a> and Acclime Cambodia\u2019s at <a href=\"https:\/\/cambodia.acclime.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">cambodia.acclime.com<\/a>.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Under agreement, NVM Group\u2019s clients consensually move to Acclime Vietnam and NVM\u2019s Vietnam staff move into Acclime&#8217;s offices.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":2821,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[97],"tags":[],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.acclime.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3554"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.acclime.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.acclime.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.acclime.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.acclime.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=3554"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.acclime.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3554\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.acclime.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/2821"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.acclime.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=3554"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.acclime.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=3554"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.acclime.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=3554"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
