Fiducia delivers integrated commercial solutions in corporate, tax, accounting and trade services.<\/p>\n<p>Its merger with Acclime is a significant addition to the company\u2019s 900-strong global workforce, which operates in 11 markets in the Asia-Pacific region including China, Hong Kong, Australia, Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, India, Philippines, Singapore, and Vietnam. Acclime also has offices in the UK, Europe (Amsterdam and Milan) and the USA.<\/p>\n<p>Co-Founder and CEO of Acclime, Martin Crawford, said the merger recognised the strong cultural and service alignment between Acclime and Fiducia, and a shared commitment to their clients and people.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cFiducia has been assisting international mid-sized companies to navigate China\u2019s complex business environment for more than 40 years and the cultural fit between our two firms is excellent,\u201d Mr Crawford said.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cKnowing the Kracht family for over 10 years, I\u2019ve admired their professionalism and quality of the relationships they have with their clients. Our strategic integration is a significant endorsement of their skills and market leadership.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe merger also provides our clients with access to a larger network of established experts in this dynamic part of the world.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis is particularly advantageous to international firms who are considering a \u201cChina + 1\u201d strategy to diversify their supply chains and manufacturing operations in Asia where Acclime is well-placed to assist.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Fiducia\u2019s Managing Director, Stefan Kracht, said the strategic merger will enable its clients to benefit from a wider spectrum of professional services and gain access to regional experts to navigate complex emerging Asian markets.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe chose to merge with Acclime because of our common professional service approach in supporting international corporate clients, and our shared values and vision to be Asia\u2019s premier compliance specialist,\u201d Mr Kracht said.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOur client commitments, the daily management of the business, and our team all remain unchanged. I am excited that as part of the Acclime family we will be able to provide our clients with access to a significant and established network of compliance and governance experts across Asia to support their growth aspirations.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a highly promising new chapter for our clients and our team with significant opportunities to grow together across Asia.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Stefan will continue to lead the Fiducia team and is a significant equity partner in Acclime.
