This security certification is an essential part of Acclime&rsquo;s mission to drive digital collaboration with clients in corporate services provision.<\/p>\n<p>ISO 27001 is an internationally accepted and widely recognised information security standard. It defines the requirements for a comprehensive Information Security Management System (ISMS) and specifies how companies should manage information in a secure manner. To achieve this certification, Acclime&#8217;s compliance was assessed by an independent security organisation after demonstrating a systematic and ongoing approach to protecting and managing customer and company data. This successful ISO 27001 certification guarantees the implementation of all the security best practices and reinforces our commitment to clients and partners to protect their information in all forms across Acclime&rsquo;s Agility platform.<\/p>\n<p>Agility is Acclime&rsquo;s complete cloud-based system to view, track and exchange documents for convenient collaboration, corporate administration and efficient management of every aspect of our clients&rsquo; corporate governance across Asia.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;Agility is a cornerstone to our Tech Enablement mission. Its ISO 27001 certification serves as independent recognition that its security management is robust and following industry practices&rdquo;, said the CIO of Acclime, Eduard Pieters. &ldquo;ISO 27001 certification, demands controls to be in place with respect, for example, to how we manage and secure Agility, including its data, development, penetration tests, access controls, backup and recovery. Having these reviewed on an annual basis, by an external party, as part of ISO 27001, provides assurance that the ISMS works and is continuously improved.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>This certification is the most recent milestone in our information security roadmap that demonstrates our ongoing commitment to data security. The data security of our clients&#8217; and partners&#8217; is a top priority for everyone at Acclime, and we are proud to have <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bsigroup.com\/en-GB\/validate-bsi-issued-certificates\/client-directory-profile\/PT_ACC-0047870871-000\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">our ISO 27001 certification<\/a> to prove it.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center; margin-top: 50px;\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/acclime-iso.png\" alt=\"Acclime logo with BSI kitemark\" width=\"900\" \/><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Acclime, the premier corporate service provider in Asia, has achieved ISO 27001 certification &#8211; a widely recognised security standard- demonstrating the company&rsquo;s commitment to information security.
