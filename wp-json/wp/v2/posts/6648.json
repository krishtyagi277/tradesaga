This move reflects a growing trend among leading professional firms to segregate their audit and advisory divisions \u2013 a shift that will become mandatory for the \u201cBig 4\u201d in the United Kingdom in 2024 \u2013 and signifies the first transaction of scale of its kind in Asia.<\/p>\n<p>On 31 July 2023, as the result of a restructuring to establish operational independence between its assurance and non-assurance operations, RSM Hong Kong left the RSM International network of member firms.<\/p>\n<p>The audit and IT consulting\u202fdivisions of RSM Hong Kong remain together and became\u202fa correspondent firm of\u202fRSM International on 24 August 2023. The firm will be adopting a new brand name shortly.<\/p>\n<p>The non-audit division has been acquired by Acclime and will operate under the Acclime Advisory Services brand. This division employs approximately 150 individuals and offers taxation, risk advisory, transaction advisory, and corporate advisory services to local and international clients.<\/p>\n<p>Martin Crawford, Co-Founder and CEO of Acclime, said the acquisition puts Acclime \u2018firmly on the map\u2019 in advisory services and will propel the development of Acclime as a fully-fledged professional services firm across Asia.<\/p>\n<p>Established in 2019, Acclime operates in 14 markets in the Asia-Pacific region with more than 13,000 active clients and over 1,100 staff.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOur strategic acquisition of the firm\u2019s non-audit business builds scale and access within Acclime\u2019s international portfolio, turbo-charging our tax practice and expanding our service line capabilities to include transaction advisory, risk advisory, and restructuring services,\u201d Mr Crawford said. \u201cAccordingly, we have created a new division within the group to foster this talent and service offering, Acclime Advisory Services, which will maintain a close working relationship with its former audit counterpart. We are looking to other Asian markets to grow our advisory business\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>Mr Crawford noted that the acquisition boosts Acclime\u2019s overall business size by around 30 per cent and follows several tactical acquisitions in recent months, including advisory firms VCFO Milne Maingay Group in New Zealand and The CFO Solution in Australia.<\/p>\n<p>Mr Eric Chen, newly appointed Managing Partner of Acclime Advisory Services and Head of the Tax Division, expressed that the professional services landscape is evolving rapidly, with regulatory changes and market demands driving firms to innovate and adapt. \u201cOur future focus will be on building a borderless pan-Asian advisory firm free from the constraints of client conflict. Clients will benefit from Acclime\u2019s expanded suite of services and technology tools. The whole team is very excited.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The undertaking represents the first major CPA practice to separate its auditing arms in Asia.<\/p>\n<h3>About former RSM Hong Kong<\/h3>\n<p>The former RSM Hong Kong was founded in 1975 and stands as a prominent accounting and consulting firm.
