I had set my eyes on working in New York or London, and only working for the top two or three law firms in the world. I saw everything else as a failure. My worldview was very limited, and very black and white.<\/p>\n<p>My own career has proven life is full of opportunities.\u00a0<strong>There are limitless routes to success, but only if you are willing to have an open and positive mindset. Don\u2019t be the person holding yourself back.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Secondly, life never goes according to plan. If Plan A doesn\u2019t work out, go for Plan B, C or D.

It was tiring. I\u2019m the same person at home, at work, with my friends. Yes be professional, but be authentic.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The 3 D\u2019s \u2013 Data, Delivery and Discernment. <\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Data \u2013 the most successful businesses harness data for competitive advantage. You might not always have access to big data in your company, or be the decision maker, but champion the power of data and access relevant statistics to your job or industry, and use it to your advantage.<\/li>\n<li>Delivery \u2013 make stuff happen. Deliver on what you are asked to do and what you\u2019ve said you\u2019ll do. So be realistic about what you can achieve and plan properly so you can always deliver without burning out in the process.<\/li>\n<li>Discernment \u2013 developing this can be hard but totally achievable. Take time to reflect and contemplate, listen to your intuition, and be open and aware. This will help you notice the details, make better decisions and connect with others.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Stop Comparing \u2013 at work, in life, ever!<\/strong> It\u2019s obviously natural to compare yourself to others and it\u2019s especially hard in this Instagram-able world we live in. But the less you worry about what others are doing and the more you focus on your values and goals, the happier you will be at work and in life.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Creative Visualisation<\/strong> \u2013 psychologically proven to change the way you think and help you manifest what you want. The more you practice the more you can achieve your goals. You can try doing it at the start of every week, before a big presentation, or even prior to a meeting which you expect to be challenging.

How you respond to those situations is what matters \u2013 listen, stay calm and admit when you\u2019re wrong.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignleft\" style=\"width: 80px; height: 80px; margin-right: 20px; margin-top: 20px; border-radius: 50%;\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/betty-teal.jpg\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Betty Gervasini <em>Partner \u2013 Acclime Vietnam<\/em><\/h3>\n<p>We all know that the corporate world has been dominated by men for centuries; however, it does not mean there is no place for women.

We are all facing similar challenges. If we can reach out to each other for support or to share ideas, this can help grow our self-confidence and push us to achieve even more. It is also important to share success stories among all of us.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignleft\" style=\"width: 80px; height: 80px; margin-right: 20px; margin-top: 20px; border-radius: 50%;\" src=\"https:\/\/cambodia.acclime.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/ly-chheng-teal.jpg\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Chheng Ly <em>Manager,\u00a0Tax\u00a0&amp;\u00a0Corporate \u2013 Acclime Cambodia<\/em><\/h3>\n<p>\u201cLuck and opportunity happen to who is ready. Be a better you and be proactive to accept a new opportunity.\u201d Saying \u201cYes\u201d to new opportunities is my advice for you. For example, when your leader assigns you to a project, rather than wait for instructions from your supervisor or being afraid of your ability, take the first step to discuss the matters with them. This way, proactivity can lead to progress for the organisation and for you as a professional.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignleft\" style=\"width: 80px; height: 80px; margin-right: 20px; margin-top: 20px; border-radius: 50%;\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/zhou-han-orange.jpg\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Zhou Han Brown <em>Partner \u2013 Acclime<\/em><\/h3>\n<p>I was brought up in Mainland China with very strict parents. It was a very different educational environment back then in comparison with now. China has always stressed the equality of men and women, in fact Chairman Mao said that women hold up half of the sky. And so I did not feel that we were any different from men when we left university to start work.<\/p>\n<p>I started my first job in 1992 working for a Chinese state-owned investment company under the Ministry of Commerce. I have since worked in different companies both Chinese and foreign in China and outside of China. Every time when I changed my job, I have learnt new things and gained new skills, but I have always approached every new challenge with an open mind and with a view to learning.<\/p>\n<p><strong>One very important lesson that I have learnt is that there will not be any development in one\u2019s professional career without hard work, no lessons learnt without mistakes.<\/strong> In China, most people in our industry are women. Women have a natural instinct to be detailed and gentle, which works well with our accounting work and a modern-day approach \u2013 empathy at work place and working as teams. Over the years of my working life, I have got a habit of not giving up, even though as I go along each journey my plan might need tweaking to taking into account different circumstances. I would like to think that women are very resilient and with perseverance. I had experienced many failures at work place, failed job interviews, missing out on promotions because my work experience was not enough. After working aboard for a few years, I returned to China with my husband in 2001 where we founded LehmanBrown International Accountants. Though working in our own business, I started learning how to fail and to learn from it, and in business there are many hard decisions that have to be made, and not all of them always go to plan. Over the 20 years with LehmanBrown and now with Acclime, I continue to challenge myself in learning and personal development.<\/p>\n<p>Women also have ability of multi-tasking and take things with a pragmatic approach. Therefore, decisions are made with sensible thoughts and planning.<\/p>\n<p>To be a leader, I always believe that you have to lead by example. That means you need to fight in the tranches with your troops! \u201cLead by example\u201d is what I think a true leader needs to have. At times, a leader has to get her\/his hands dirty to figure out with the team members. A leader should not be feared, but should aspire the team members. Aspiring is not enough, leaders need to give the support to their teams when they need it. That is a leader needs to have the guts to make tough decisions with a view that it may not always be the right one.<\/p>\n<p><strong>To the six amazing women, we thank you for honestly sharing your growth stories with us.
